Once the installation is complete, you can run Pankegg using:

```bash
pankegg_make_db --help
pankegg_app --help
```

If the commands are not in your PATH then use the whole path to the executable.

For more detailed instructions on how to use Pankegg, see the [Usage and Tests](#usage-and-tests) section.
