## AI and LLM

AI/LLM were used as "writing buddy" during the redaction of the README.md (e.g. ensuring a readable markdown structure and correcting the syntax/grammar).
The logic and code were initially made by humans (@RVanDamme and @Avanbelle), before using AI/LLM on the code to debug and refactor it.
