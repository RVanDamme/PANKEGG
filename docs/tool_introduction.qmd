Pankegg is composed of two main tools:  

- **Pankegg Make DB**, the data parser and SQL database creator ([Pankegg_make_db.py](Pankegg_make_db.qmd)), which processes a CSV file where each line lists the required input files for a single sample. It compiles the information from these files into a structured SQL database, making downstream exploration fast and efficient,  and  
- **Pankegg APP**, the web server for interactive data exploration ([Pankegg_app.py](Pankegg_app.qmd)), which uses the database generated by the parser and provides an interactive browser-based interface to explore your results.

The web interface is divided into two main categories:

- **Navigation and Search:** Effortlessly browse and filter all available data to find exactly what you need.
- **Features:** Visualize data, compare bins or samples, and generate insightful plots.

### Navigation and Search Pages

| Page Name  | Usage                                                                                                                            | Possible Filters                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Bins       | Visualize all bins for each sample, review CheckM2 quality and classifications. Generate quality plots, see maps/KEGGs for bins. | Sample Name, Bin Name, Taxonomy, Maps, KEGGs          |
| Maps       | Visualize all pathways detected in your data, check pathway “completeness”, highlight orthologs present per pathway.             | Sample Name, Bin Name, Taxonomy, Map (ID/Name), KEGGs |
| KEGGs      | List all KEGGs present globally or in a specific bin; find patterns in ortholog/bin names.                                       | Ortholog Name Pattern, Bin Name (via Bins page)       |
| Taxonomy   | View tables for each taxonomic rank, listing taxa found and their abundance.                                                   | Taxonomic Rank                                        |

## Feature Pages

Pankegg provides multiple interactive features:

- **Sample vs Sample:** Heatmap of selected pathways, scatter plots for bin quality, PCA of bins, tables/plots showing KEGGs unique or shared between samples/pathways.
- **Bin vs Bin:** Plot and table of KEGGs shared or unique between two bins for metabolic pathways.
- **Taxonomic Comparison:** For a given rank, see sample-wise composition plots (abundance = number of bins classified as taxon / total bins), and pathway-vs-taxa heatmaps.
- **PCA:** Dedicated page for visualizing principal component analysis (PCA) of each sample, based on KOs, maps, or taxonomy.

> **Note:**  
> In this documentation, the terms “map” and “pathway” are sometimes used interchangeably. Typically, “map” refers to the KEGG database’s map ID (e.g., `map00010`), while “pathway” refers to the biological pathway name. Although the KEGG database provides both a pathway ID and a map ID, this tool focuses on the map ID, which is generally more complete and reliable for referencing metabolic pathways.
